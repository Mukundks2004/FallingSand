# FallingSand
my first javascript project where i try to simulate falling sand


I havent ever used javascript before or typescript or anything frontend so this will be a nice foray into that field

The goal of this project is to have falling sand so you can click and drag and sand drops onto the floor :D

# omg mukund is so cool
