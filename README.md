# FallingSand
My first javascript project where I simulate falling sand.

The goal of this project is to have falling sand so you can click and drag and sand drops onto the floor.

This program is written using a library called p5js which manages animations and clicks.

Note: while I initially changed the program to make it run faster, the goal of FallingSand is not speed but to correctly reproduce the essence of a falling sand program, which this does. The additional feature of coloured sand is not strictly necessary but comes before speed in terms of priority.

## Update
Added colour selector
