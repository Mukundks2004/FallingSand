# FallingSand
my first javascript project where i try to simulate falling sand


I havent ever used javascript before or typescript or anything frontend so this will be a nice foray into that field

The goal of this project is to have falling sand so you can click and drag and sand drops onto the floor :D

# omg mukund is so cool

from here i am going to practice typing some crap just so i can get a feel for markdown

## this is a smaller heading

### this is a tinier heading, it has 3 hashes

* this is a list point
* this is another list point
    * ooh what happends now??

1. this is ordered
1. number two
1. number three
    1. indented

1. back a line, but with a space

and now some text again before we get into formatting

\\ backslash escapes characters such as \*

otherwise \* cause *italics* and if you do them twice you get **BOLD**
same goes for \_ underscores

~~you can do strikethrough with tildes but pretend i did not just tell you that~~

# Another heading before we move on
---
this is sandwiched between lines

# Now for the real fun:

__it's time for some github specific stuff!__

I wonder if theres an extension cuz i would loove some latex in here

```python

def my_private_func(my_paramter):
    # do some stuff woah it's green
    print("Mukund is so cool!")
    return my_parameter ** 2
```

> Mukund, 2024
